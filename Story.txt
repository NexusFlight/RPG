You Awake in a dungeon
There is a Guard Standing in the corner
He heard your breathing change
He turns to face you
"We have waited for you to awake for your Execution!"

You notice the walls of your cell are made of red throbbing veins!
You find A Stone Sword!
/W /N 0 N/
You came to a split path
What route do you take?
/D Left or Right D/
